# üß† Binance Testnet Trading Bot  
_A Modular Algorithmic Trading Framework built with Python and Streamlit_

---

## üöÄ Overview

This project is a **fully functional Binance Futures Testnet trading bot** that supports **Market**, **Limit**, **OCO**, and **TWAP** orders ‚Äî all accessible via both **CLI commands** and a **Streamlit web dashboard**.

It‚Äôs designed with a **modular Python architecture**, robust **validation**, and **structured logging**, making it ideal for both learning and extending to real-world trading automation.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Market Orders** | Executes instant buy/sell orders using `client.futures_create_order`. |
| **Limit Orders** | Places price-specific orders with proper precision validation. |
| **TWAP Strategy** | Splits orders into timed intervals to minimize slippage. |
| **Synthetic OCO Logic** | Emulates One-Cancels-the-Other orders for risk management. |
| **Streamlit UI** | Provides an interactive dashboard with real-time PnL, positions, and control. |
| **Error Logging** | Every order, validation, and exception logged in `bot.log`. |

## üí° Advanced Capabilities

### üïí TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price)
_File: `src/advanced/twap.py`_

* Divides a total quantity into smaller trades executed at fixed time intervals.
* Reduces market impact of large trades.

### üîÅ OCO (One-Cancels-the-Other)
_File: `src/advanced/oco.py`_

* Simulates Futures OCO using dual conditional orders (`TAKE_PROFIT_MARKET`, `STOP_MARKET`).
* Uses `reduceOnly=True` to prevent overexposure.

### üñ•Ô∏è Streamlit Web UI
_File: `app.py`_

| Component | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Live PnL Tracking** | Real-time Unrealized PnL with green/red color codes. |
| **Active Position Monitor** | Lists all open positions with size, entry, and PnL. |
| **Position Exit Tab** | Safely closes any open trade using a market order. |
